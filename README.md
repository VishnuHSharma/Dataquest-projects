# SQL Python Project
This project utilizes Python and Jupyter Notebook environment as well as SQLite Database. These tools are used to answer questions from the factbook table containing information about various countries. This was a part of a guided project from the Dataquest Data Scientist Path, but I took the liberty to extend it and do some of my own analysis and run queries and answer some of my own questions.

This project utilized SQlite, however alot of the SQL commands tend to overlap so the SQL commands is what is important.
