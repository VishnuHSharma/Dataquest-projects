# Dataquest-projects
These are the completed guided projects that are part of the Dataquest Data Scientist Path. The first project titled SqlProject uses Python, Pandas, Sqlite3, and Seaborn to answer questions from the factbook table. This was a part of a guided project from the Dataquest Data Scientist Path, but I took the liberty to extend it and do some of my own analysis and run queries and answer some of my own questions.
